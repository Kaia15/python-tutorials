### Concurrency in Python

#### Core (Processor)
- Definition: The actual hardware unit inside a CPU that executes the instructions. There are multiple cores in modern CPUs(s).
Each core can run one thread at a time (however, with the hyper-threading technique, which makes a single core appear as two logical cores, there might be two threads running on the same core at a time).

#### Thread
- Definition: the smallest unit of execution within a process. 
- Property: 
    Multiple threads from one process share memory and resources but have their own instruction pointers, stacks, and registers.
    - One example of a multi-threading process: **Microsoft Word**
        - Thread 1: Format the text.
        - Thread 2: process the inputs.
        - Thread 3: control users' clicking, typing, and scrolling.

    - Code: 
    ```
    import threading
    import os

    def task1():
        print("Task 1 assigned to thread: {}".format(threading.current_thread().name))
        print("ID of process running task 1: {}".format(os.getpid()))

    def task2():
        print("Task 2 assigned to thread: {}".format(threading.current_thread().name))
        print("ID of process running task 2: {}".format(os.getpid()))

    def main():

        print("ID of process running main program: {}".format(os.getpid()))

        print("Main thread name: {}".format(threading.current_thread().name))

        t1 = threading.Thread(target=task1, name='t1')
        t2 = threading.Thread(target=task2, name='t2')

        t1.start()
        t2.start()

        print (f"The number of alive threads is {threading.active_count()}")

        t1.join()
        t2.join()

    main()

    # Output: 
    # ID of process running main program: 10392
    # Main thread name: MainThread
    # Task 1 assigned to thread: t1
    # ID of process running task 1: 10392
    # Task 2 assigned to thread: t2
    # The number of alive threads is 3
    # ID of process running task 2: 10392

    ```

- **Daemon** Thread:
- **Same core** or **Different Cores**?
  - We can bind a process to a CPU core, but we cannot bind a thread to a specific CPU core. Therefore, a thread is executed by which CPU core, depending on O.S scheduling.

##### Threading Library
##### AsyncIO

#### Process
##### Visualize multi-processes
- Ref: https://medium.com/pythoneers/visualize-your-multiprocessing-calculations-in-python-with-parallelbar-5395651f35aa
- By using `Pool`, we can *spawn* a new process created by `multiprocessing` library in Python.
